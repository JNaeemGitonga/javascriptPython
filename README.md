#  Make A Date

## What is it?
Small appointment app using JavaScript and Python 3. This is my first time using Python üë®üèΩ‚Äç! I had fun and learned a lot about the language in this exercise. I went from knowing nothing about Python to getting a Python back end app running that serves HTML and has a SQLite DB that stores and searches for your appointments--in less than two days. Looking forward to learning and doing more with Python.
